# Bank-management-system.
In this project I had used the C++ programming language as this is object orientd programming language 
C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.C++ is fun and easy to learn!As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.

In this project we take the input from the user it contains all the details of the individual  And there is sing in window, log in window, and we generate persons ID and can update the information of the individual. It also shows the transaction,withdraw done by the person and can remove the detail that we want to remove. but as every thing have some drawback in this project we don't have the password management system.
